# ML_Naive_Bayes_Classifier

It is a multiclass classification problem. The data is used href="https://github.com/Krishnkumar542/Practical_Statistics_for_Data_Scientists/blob/main/Practical%20Statistics%20for%20Data%20Scientists%2050%20Essential%20Concepts.pdf">irish flower dataset</a> . In this dataset the number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 210 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

- Sepal length in cm
- Sepal width in cm
- Petal length in cm
- Petal width in cm
- Species

Letâ€™s use this standard iris dataset to predict the Species of flower using 4 different features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. This data is work well with the Naive Bayes classifier with the accuracy of 95%.
