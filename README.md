# ML_Naive_Bayes_Classifier
Classifying iris flower dataset by using Naive Bayes classifier
It is a multiclass classification problem. The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 210 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

Sepal length in cm
Sepal width in cm
Petal length in cm
Petal width in cm
Species

Letâ€™s use this standard iris dataset to predict the Species of flower using 4 different features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. This model is work well with the Naive Bayes classifier with the accuracy of 95%.
